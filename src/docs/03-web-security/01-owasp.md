# Owasp 



The 2017 OWASP Top Ten:

- `Injection`:    
Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- `Broken Authentication`:    
This involves functions related to authentication and session management being implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords or keys.
- `Sensitive Data Exposure`:    
Inadequate encryption or protection of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access.
- `XML External Entities (XXE`):    
This refers to older or poorly configured XML processors evaluating external entity references within XML documents.
- `Broken Access Control`:    
Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.
- `Security Misconfigurations`:    
This involves default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information.
- `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)`:    
XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without adequate validation or escaping.
- `Insecure Deserialization`:    
Deserialization issues allow an attacker to execute code in the application remotely, to make unauthorized system changes, or to obtain unauthorized data access.
- `Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities`:   
This pertains to using components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, with known vulnerabilities that may undermine application defenses.
- `Insufficient Logging & Monitoring`:    
Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data.
