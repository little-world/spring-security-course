# SHA-256

To generate an SHA-256 hash in Java, you can use the MessageDigest class from the java.security package. Below is a simple example to generate an SHA-256 hash for a given string.


```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;

public class SHA256Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello, World!";
        
        try {
            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
            byte[] hash = digest.digest(text.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
            StringBuilder hexString = new StringBuilder();
            
            for (byte b : hash) {
                String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & b);
                if (hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');
                hexString.append(hex);
            }
            
            System.out.println("Hexadecimal Hash: " + hexString);
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(); // Handle the exception appropriately in production code
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256") is used to get an instance of the MessageDigest object that implements SHA-256. The input string is converted to bytes and passed to the digest method, which returns the hash as a byte array. Finally, the byte array is converted to a hexadecimal string for display.

#### Notes:
This example is useful for learning purposes, but in a production environment, you would typically want to handle exceptions more gracefully and securely.

If you're hashing passwords or other sensitive data, consider using a secure, adaptive hashing algorithm like bcrypt, along with proper salting and key stretching techniques, to protect against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

For storing sensitive data securely, also consider cryptographic techniques like encryption, and ensure you follow best practices for key management.
